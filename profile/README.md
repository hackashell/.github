## Project Description

DeFi Omni Dapps uses advanced Shell Protocol architecture and integrates Uniswap V4 as the first external DeFi primitive within the Shell ecosystem. The end goal is to have a single protocol which can work with any DeFi primitive making the first true endless composability. Omni Dapps are the future of DeFi

## How it's Made

We have used Shell Protocol's accounting smart contract called Ocean and integrated Uniswap V4 to work with it. We have also added 1inch swap quote API to fetch the prices for the token pairs. In addition we have used MetaMask SDK (through wagmi library) and ENS Thourin component library form some frontend components and write subgraph
